# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Code Migration CLI is a cross-platform Node.js tool designed to help developers identify and fix deprecated API usages and invalid syntax patterns in their codebases. The tool scans source code files, applies configurable rules to detect issues, and provides both reporting and automatic fixing capabilities with colored terminal output for enhanced user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to scan my project directory for deprecated API usages and syntax issues, so that I can identify technical debt and potential problems in my codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the CLI tool with a target directory THEN the system SHALL recursively scan all source code files in that directory
2. WHEN scanning files THEN the system SHALL apply rules from a configurable rules.json file to detect patterns
3. WHEN patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL collect and store findings with file path, line number, and rule information
4. WHEN scanning is complete THEN the system SHALL display findings in a colored, readable terminal format
5. WHEN no issues are found THEN the system SHALL display a success message indicating the scan completed with no issues

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure custom rules for pattern detection, so that I can adapt the tool to my specific codebase and migration needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load rules from a rules.json configuration file
2. WHEN rules.json contains JavaScript deprecation patterns THEN the system SHALL detect those patterns in .js files
3. WHEN rules.json contains Python syntax patterns THEN the system SHALL detect those patterns within string content
4. WHEN rules.json contains general patterns THEN the system SHALL apply those patterns across all supported file types
5. IF rules.json is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL display an error message and exit gracefully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically fix simple pattern replacements with a --fix flag, so that I can quickly migrate large codebases without manual editing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the tool with --fix flag THEN the system SHALL create backup copies of all files before making changes
2. WHEN applying fixes THEN the system SHALL only replace patterns that have a defined replacement in the rules
3. WHEN fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL update the original files with the corrected patterns
4. WHEN backup creation fails THEN the system SHALL abort the fix operation and display an error message
5. WHEN fixes are complete THEN the system SHALL display a summary of files modified and patterns replaced

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working on different operating systems, I want the tool to work consistently across Windows, Linux, and Mac, so that my team can use it regardless of their development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool runs on Windows THEN it SHALL handle Windows file paths and line endings correctly
2. WHEN the tool runs on Linux THEN it SHALL handle Unix file paths and line endings correctly  
3. WHEN the tool runs on Mac THEN it SHALL handle Mac file paths and line endings correctly
4. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL preserve original file encoding and line endings
5. WHEN displaying output THEN the system SHALL use appropriate terminal colors for each platform

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear command-line options and usage instructions, so that I can quickly understand how to use the tool effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the tool without arguments THEN the system SHALL display help information with usage examples
2. WHEN the user provides --help flag THEN the system SHALL display detailed command options and descriptions
3. WHEN the user provides invalid arguments THEN the system SHALL display an error message and usage instructions
4. WHEN the tool completes execution THEN it SHALL display a summary report with statistics
5. WHEN the user provides --version flag THEN the system SHALL display the current version number

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tool to be beginner-friendly with clean, commented code, so that I can understand and potentially extend its functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN all functions SHALL have clear comments explaining their purpose
2. WHEN examining the code structure THEN it SHALL follow consistent naming conventions and organization
3. WHEN reading the README THEN it SHALL include clear installation and usage instructions with examples
4. WHEN looking at error messages THEN they SHALL be descriptive and suggest corrective actions
5. WHEN the code handles edge cases THEN those cases SHALL be documented with comments
